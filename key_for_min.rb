# prereqs: iterators, hashes, conditional logic
# Given a hash with numeric values, return the key for the smallest value

#There's gotta be an easier way.  A way
#to do it with one #each or something.
#but since we aren't using the enummethods
#that make this easy, I have no idea how to
#find a min in one #each. without setting 
# a min_value outside the loop to something
#so big I hope no one would have it as a value.
# That seems like a hacky thing, so this is 
#how I'm doing it
